So why wait until it's too late? Have you realized that your Computer runs slowly or do you come across software problems, errors or blinking crashes? If you answered "yes" to any of the above questions, you may have a form of malware (malicious software) on your computer, tablet, or phone. Combat these threats by eradicating the malware before it irreparably destroys your device. Much like a vehicle, computers run better only if they get regular technical maintenance. Don't wait until your computer fails before maintaining it.  That's where AIGC comes in. We offer the following services:</p>

When criminals are constantly changing their methods of attack, you also need to stay two steps ahead to defend your company and image. Any time that you have something, there will always be those who will try to take it from you. That's the burden of operating a successful business. Whether they are trying to enter your network to steal confidential information, or want to delete, alter, or corrupt important information, AIGC will be there to assemble your first line of defense against attackers. We do this by implementing many of the leading brands of Anti-Malware Programs and firewall installations to protect your computers and networks as well as high-tech physical security. We also provide training sessions, either at your office or a neutral location, to instruct and train your employees on the importance of network security and how to keep themselves safe from cyber criminals. Don't be a cyber victim. Defend yourself with wisdom.</p>
